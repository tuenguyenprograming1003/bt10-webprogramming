demo1-inmemory-security

This folder should contain the full demo1 project (copied from your current workspace). If you want this folder to contain the exact project files, move the project root files into this folder before committing/pushing.

Files to include:
- pom.xml
- src/
- mvnw, mvnw.cmd, .mvn/

Note: I created placeholders for demo2 and demo3 in the parent folder. To push to GitHub, run git init/add/commit/push from the parent folder in your machine where you have credentials.
