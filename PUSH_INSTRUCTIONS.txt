To push the 'spring-security-6-demos' folder to your GitHub repo (run this locally where you have git credentials):

cd /path/to/your/workspace/demo
# if you want the folder to contain the actual demo1 project, move files into spring-security-6-demos/demo1-inmemory-security
# Example (optional): mv pom.xml src mvnw mvnw.cmd .mvn spring-security-6-demos/demo1-inmemory-security/

cd spring-security-6-demos
git init
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "Add demo1-inmemory-security and placeholders for demo2/demo3"
# Add your remote (HTTPS or SSH)
git remote add origin https://github.com/tuenguyenprograming1003/bt10-webprogramming.git
# Push (you may be prompted for credentials or use PAT/SSH key)
git push -u origin main

If push fails due to authentication, set up:
- SSH key and add to GitHub (recommended), then use git remote set-url origin git@github.com:tuenguyenprograming1003/bt10-webprogramming.git
- Or create a Personal Access Token (PAT) and use it with HTTPS push.

If you want, I can provide exact commands to set up an SSH key and add it to GitHub.
